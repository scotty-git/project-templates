# Planning Instructions: Creating Your Project Documentation

## Overview
This guide helps you create project documentation in two phases:
1. Quick Start (README-template-quick.md): Essential project details for getting started
2. Comprehensive Plan (README-template-full.md): Detailed documentation for full development

## Starting the Conversation

Begin with a casual explanation of your project idea:
```
"I want to build [type of app]. Here's what I'm thinking:

1. The Problem:
   - What frustrates users currently
   - Why existing solutions aren't ideal

2. My Solution:
   - Core idea
   - Main benefits
   - Target users

3. Key Features:
   - List 3-5 main things the app should do
   - Any specific requirements or preferences"
```

## Iterating with AI

After getting initial feedback, have a back-and-forth conversation to refine:

1. Technical Choices
   ```
   "For this kind of app, what modern tech stack would you recommend?
   I'm interested in things like:
   - Frontend framework
   - Database options
   - Authentication
   - Any other essential services"
   ```

2. Feature Details
   ```
   "Let's break down how these features would work:
   - User flows
   - Data storage needs
   - Integration requirements"
   ```

3. Development Structure
   ```
   "How should we organize the development:
   - Key modules needed
   - Core dependencies
   - Basic project structure"
   ```

## Phase 1: Quick Start README

After initial discussion, create the Quick Start README:
```
"Based on our discussion, could you help me fill out this Quick Start template?

[Paste the entire contents of README-template-quick.md here]

Please focus on just the essential details needed to begin development."
```

## Phase 2: Comprehensive README

Once the Quick Start is solid and you're ready to dive deeper:
```
"Now that we have the basics, let's create the full project blueprint.

[Paste the entire contents of README-template-full.md here]

Please expand upon our Quick Start, adding all the detailed sections while maintaining consistency with our initial plan."
```

## Refining the README

Review the generated README and ask for improvements:
```
"Could you help me enhance:
- Any unclear sections
- Technical details
- Setup instructions
- Development guidelines"
```

## Best Practices

1. Start Simple
   - Focus on core features first
   - Get the basic structure right
   - Validate your approach early

2. Build in Layers
   - Quick Start for essential details
   - Full README for comprehensive planning
   - Each phase should be immediately actionable

3. Maintain Consistency
   - Ensure both READMEs align
   - Quick Start should be a subset of full README
   - Keep technical decisions consistent

4. Keep Initial Conversation Natural
   - Start with your basic idea
   - Let AI ask clarifying questions
   - Build understanding through dialogue

5. Focus on Clarity
   - Explain ideas in simple terms
   - Ask for clarification when needed
   - Confirm understanding of technical suggestions

6. Iterate as Needed
   - Review AI suggestions
   - Ask for alternatives
   - Refine based on preferences

## AI Model Selection Guide

Choose the right AI model for each phase of your project planning:

### Initial Research & Planning (GPT-4)
Best for:
- Exploring current tech trends and best practices
- Researching similar applications and solutions
- Getting real-time information about technologies
- Initial brainstorming and feature ideation
- Tech stack recommendations

Why: GPT-4's extensive knowledge of recent developments and ability to access internet information makes it ideal for initial research and modern tech decisions.

### Documentation Creation (GPT-1)
Best for:
- Creating detailed, structured documentation
- Writing comprehensive technical specifications
- Generating clear, consistent documentation
- Converting rough ideas into polished documentation
- Maintaining documentation standards

Why: GPT-1's focus on precision and structure makes it excellent for creating high-quality, standardized documentation once you have all the raw information.

### Technical Implementation (Claude)
Best for:
- Solving specific coding problems
- Debugging complex issues
- Writing efficient algorithms
- Implementing security best practices
- Optimizing performance

Why: Claude excels at detailed technical tasks and provides well-reasoned, precise coding solutions.

### Workflow Tips
1. Start with GPT-4 for initial planning and research
2. Use Claude for any specific technical questions that arise
3. Finally, use GPT-1 to create polished documentation
4. Return to appropriate model for iterations and updates

## Remember
- Quick Start README is for rapid initialization
- Full README is your complete project blueprint
- Both documents should be immediately actionable
- Move to Phase 2 when you're confident in the basic approach
- The README is your blueprint for Cascade
- Be clear about your preferences and constraints
- Don't hesitate to ask for clarification
- Iterate until you're satisfied with the plan

The goal is to get you started quickly while ensuring you have a path to comprehensive documentation when needed.
